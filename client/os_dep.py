        This class is meant duplicate the behaviour of ldconfig and parse
        /etc/ld.so.conf and all the related config files Since the only specification
        for ldconfig is in the source code, this class is as much as possible a
        line-by-line direct translation from the C to Python.

        Currently we attempt to preserve the following behaviours, with caveats

        * include parsing is recursive, included files can include /etc/ld.so.conf,
          ldconfig.c has it's recursion depth limited by the process max file open
          limit.  We artifically limit the recursion depth to MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH

        * The library type suffix, .e.g. '/usr/lib/foo=glibc2' is correctly parsed and
          stored.  There can be any amount of whitespace between the end of the path
          and the type suffix.  We do not overwrite duplicate paths with new flag
          information.

        * hwcap is currently ignored.  Ideally we would parse the hwcap and add those
          directories to the search path based on runtime parsing of the HW
          capabilities set in /proc/cpuinfo, but that is not implemented.

        * The hardcoded hwcap of 'tls' is added to COMMON_LIB_PATHS during runtime
          constant definition.  This means we search /usr/lib64/tls by default.

        This current translation is based on elf/ldconfig.c from glibc-2.16-34.fc18.src.rpm
